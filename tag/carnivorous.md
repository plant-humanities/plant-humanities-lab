Plants that trap and digest insects or other small organisms to supplement nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. Adaptations include sticky glands, pitfall traps, or snap-shut leaves. Examples such as Venus flytrap and Nepenthes pitcher plants rely on these mechanisms to acquire nitrogen and phosphorus unavailable in their habitats.
