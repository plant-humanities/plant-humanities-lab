Plants whose edible parts provide a distinctive sour, salty, or aromatic punch when added in small amounts—e.g., tamarind pulp or horseradish root. Unlike “spice,” condiments are typically used fresh, pickled, or as pastes rather than dried powders. The tag draws attention to crops valued more for flavor enhancement than bulk nutrition.
