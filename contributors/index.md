## Thomas C. Anderson

[Thomas C. Anderson]()

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plant-humanities/media/main/contributors/Anderson.jpg)

Anderson’s research, which draws upon both historical archival studies as well as plant biology and botany, explores how early modern colonial encounters with the natural world helped shape our modern pharmacopoeia.

To the early modern naturalist and explorer, the keys to life’s greatest mysteries were to be found in the petals, leaves, and anthers of strange and exotic plants. Amerindian horticultural, botanical, and art-historical contributions to this complicated and multifaceted story have only recently emerged as a subject of scholarly interest. Anderson uses the history of medicine and botany to help elucidate the unknown pasts that have nonetheless had a major impact on the construction of scientific and medical knowledge up to today. Anderson is a master’s candidate at Columbia University. He holds a bachelor’s in history and French and Francophone Studies from Hamilton College. Anderson has explored transoceanic acclimatization and the indigenous Guanche pharmacopoeia in the Canary Islands; the early modern history of imperial science and medicine in Paris; ethnobotany and plant taxonomy at the New York Botanical Gardens; historical manuscripts concerning colonial plants and their uses at the John Carter Brown Library; and toxicity and plant defense systems at Cornell University.

The four-year initiative seeks to advance the emerging field of plant humanities in dialogue with the environmental humanities and with a focus on plant-human interactions. It encompasses the Plant Humanities Lab, an innovative digital space that supports the study of plants from the perspectives of the arts, sciences, and humanities. Related programming at Dumbarton Oaks includes fellowships, scholarly events, and a summer program that brings together students from various disciplines to explore the cultural histories of plants, learn digital skills, and contribute to the Plant Humanities Lab. Batsaki holds a PhD in comparative literature from Harvard University and coedited _The Botany of Empire in the Long Eighteenth Century_ (Dumbarton Oaks, 2016) with co-investigator Anatole Tchikine and Sarah Burke-Cahalan.

## Camilo Uribe Botta

[Camilo Uribe Botta]()

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plant-humanities/media/main/contributors/Botta.jpg)

Uribe Botta’s current PhD research explores the orchid trade between Colombia and the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century, focusing on the global connections created around the plants on both sides of the Atlantic.

His research analyzes the networks around these plants, from their hunting in the Colombian jungles to their conservation in British Botanical Gardens or collections from wealthy British collectors. Its overall aim is to chart the economic, scientific, and cultural conditions that led to the success of tropical orchids as a scientific and a commodity object. He focuses on the agency of orchids in global history and their relationship with humans in nineteenth-century commerce. Botta is a PhD candidate in history at the University of Warwick. He holds a bachelor’s and a master’s in history from Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, Colombia. Uribe Botta has been assistant curator and registrar and collections manager of the Museo Colonial and Museo Santa Clara, two public institutions that are part of the Ministry of Culture of Colombia.

## Verónica Matallana Chaves

[Verónica Matallana Chaves]()

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plant-humanities/media/main/contributors/Chaves.jpg)

Matallana Chaves’s undergraduate thesis research focuses on the history of textile work in Colombia and the use of natural fibers with a botanical-historical approach. Given the country’s sociocultural diversity, material cultural objects with an artisan trajectory play a key role in the consolidation of identities and symbolic networks.

Although these objects have a consolidated historical trajectory, their agency has been changing as they have been touched by the dynamics of conservation, commodification, and resignification. Her work brings these points of tension and breakdowns in craft traditions to the surface. Chaves is in her third year of the undergraduate program in history at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where she has participated in projects on digital history, environmental history, and oral history and memory. She is currently part of the Public and Digital History group and is linked to the Laboratory of Historical Cartography and Digital History.

## Rachel Hirsch

[Rachel Hirsch]()

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plant-humanities/media/main/contributors/hirsch.jpg)

What was it that made the gardens constructed throughout the Mughal Empire (1526–1857) such as Burhanpur’s Lal Bagh so appealing to these otherwise disgruntled travelers? What can we glean about their plant composition, function, and reception from textual, visual, and material sources? These and other related questions drive Hirsch’s current research on the art and architectural history of early modern South Asia. 

Her goal is to characterize perceptions of land and their relationship to the changing forms and functions of gardens in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Ultimately, by underscoring the historical connections between humans, plants, and cultural production, she hopes to generate new understandings of territory in the early modern period.
Rachel Hirsch is a PhD candidate in history of art and architecture at Harvard University and a cultural historian of early modern South Asia. Her research interests include urban construction, perceptions of land and territory, garden history, and the potential for new art historical methods and sources. Her latest project took as its focus the Mughal city of Burhanpur and explored in depth its transformation through symbolic appropriation, ornamentation, and expansion along an underground water distribution system in the seventeenth century. She has also written extensively about Timurid and Mughal gardens and the role of travel writing in understandings of place.

[Wouter Klein]()

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plant-humanities/media/main/contributors/Klein_300x300.jpg)

Wouter Klein is Plant Humanities fellow at Dumbarton Oaks. A historian from the Netherlands, he received his PhD from Utrecht University in 2018. He is interested in the interconnected history of medicine, pharmacy, and botany in the early modern period; the circulation of knowledge and commodification processes of therapeutic drugs; and digital research methods to study medical practices of the past over the long term. 

He has a particular interest in the availability of materia medica in the past, either as commercial goods in trade records, research specimens for academic physicians, or commodified products for the general public. His research aims to unravel the question of how the global dimensions of commerce, science, and society helped some non-European natural substances become major commercial ingredients for medicines while others had much less success in the early modern medical marketplace. To tell those stories, his research makes use of large collections of digital historical data, like private correspondence, pharmaceutical manuals, auction records, and newspaper advertisements.

## Anna Lawrence

[Anna Lawrence]()

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plant-humanities/media/main/contributors/Lawrence.jpg)

Grounded theoretically in critical plant studies, Lawrence is interested in the material intimacies at play in these different spheres of plant-human interaction and how they were thought about at the time, seeking to illuminate a world of alternative and exaggerated sensibilities between people and plants to help us question our own approaches to plant nature today. Lawrence is a PhD student in the Department of Geography at the University of Cambridge where she also undertook her undergraduate and master’s degrees. She is a cultural and historical geographer interested in plant-human relationships.
